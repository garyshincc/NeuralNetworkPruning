# NeuralNetworkPruning

Experiment: Neural networks with high hidden dimensions do not need all the connections to do accurate inferences.
By "pruning" neural networks, i.e. cutting off / masking the neurons at the latent level, you can see how much neurons can be pruned before accuracy suffers heavily.

Use cases: Train a deep and wide neural network, perform transfer learning on a much smaller network designed by pruning the larger network.
